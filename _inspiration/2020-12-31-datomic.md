I find really interesting when people don't do things in the standard way. A few weeks ago someone asked to the founder of RoamResearch (I product is getting some attention) what their tech stack was. He answered ["Clojure, Datomic"](https://twitter.com/Conaw/status/1320155656301596672) which is not the tyipical web stack. 

Anyway, I didn't hear about Datomit before so after taking a look to their website I got interested (as always) in "how it works".

I found [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TYfcyvSpEQ) which is really interesting, specially because you realize that every single database should work like that but likely hardware 30 years ago was not perfomant enough to do that.
