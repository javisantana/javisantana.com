Today there are 40 days left to my 40th birdthday. I've been working with data for 20+ years now and I feel like trying to summarize what I learned in a few points.

I'll share one thing every day until I turn 40.

## 1. It's hard to capture reality with data

Trying to recreate an accurate version of the reality, no matter what that is or how simple looks like, is hard. 

Other way to see it: modeling reality always get complex. There are always small nuances, special conditions, things that changed, edge cases and, of course, errors (which sometimes became features)

The only models I found easy to work with and understand are the ones that reflect computer things.
